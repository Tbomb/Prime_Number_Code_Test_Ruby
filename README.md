# Prime Number Code Test in Ruby
##
 This is will determine the 333rd prime number that both begins and ends with a 3.
 Here, I am using a custom method to determine if the number is prime.
 I am aware of the prime?() method available in the Ruby Prime class, but this was not used
 as it is not in the spirit of the question asked.
